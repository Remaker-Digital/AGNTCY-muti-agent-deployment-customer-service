- ✅ 5 production-ready prompts in evaluation/prompts/

**Focus:** Optimized AI model interactions BEFORE full Azure deployment (cost-minimization strategy)
- Direct Azure OpenAI API testing without full infrastructure
- Iterative prompt engineering for all agent types
- Model selection (GPT-4o vs GPT-4o-mini per agent)
- Evaluation dataset creation (100+ representative conversations)
- Human evaluation of response quality

**Rationale:** Quality depends on AI interactions. Iterate at ~$20-50/month instead of ~$310-360/month.

**Exit Criteria (ALL MET):**
1. Intent Classification: >85% accuracy → **98% ACHIEVED**
2. Response Generation: >80% quality score → **88.4% ACHIEVED**
3. Escalation Detection: <10% FP, >95% TP → **0% FP, 100% TP ACHIEVED**
4. Critic/Supervisor: <5% FP, 100% adversarial block → **0% FP, 100% TP ACHIEVED**
5. RAG Retrieval: >90% retrieval@3 → **100% retrieval@1 ACHIEVED**
6. Robustness: >80% appropriateness → **82% ACHIEVED**
7. Cost Projection: <$60/month for Phase 4 AI → **~$48-62/month PROJECTED**

**Completed Deliverables:**
- `evaluation/test_harness.py` - Complete test framework
- `evaluation/datasets/` - 7 datasets (375 samples total)
- `evaluation/prompts/` - 5 production-ready final prompts
- `evaluation/results/` - 6 evaluation reports + completion summary
- Model selection: GPT-4o-mini for all agents (sufficient quality, lower cost)

**Key Learnings:**
1. Defense in depth works (Azure filter + Critic prompt = 100% block rate)
2. LLM-as-Judge requires calibration guidelines
3. Few-shot examples are critical for edge cases
4. Register matching is essential for appropriateness
5. GPT-4o-mini is sufficient for all classification/validation tasks

**See evaluation/results/PHASE-3.5-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md for full details**

**Focus:** Terraform infrastructure, multi-language support, real API integration, new architectural components
- Deploy to Azure East US region
- Add Canadian French and Spanish language support
- Integrate real Shopify, Zendesk, Mailchimp APIs
- Azure DevOps Pipelines CI/CD
- **NEW:** Deploy Azure Key Vault, NATS JetStream, Cosmos DB vector search, Azure OpenAI

**When working on Phase 4:**
- ALWAYS check cost implications before suggesting Azure services
- Prefer: Container Instances over App Service, Cosmos Serverless over provisioned, Basic tiers
- Avoid: Azure Front Door, Traffic Manager, Premium tiers, geo-replication (unless absolutely necessary)
- Use Terraform for ALL Azure resources
- Implement aggressive auto-scaling (down to 1 instance during idle)
- 7-day log retention (not 30-day default)

**New Architectural Components (Added 2026-01-22):**
1. **PII Tokenization:** Azure Key Vault for token storage, fallback to Cosmos if latency >100ms

6. **Execution Tracing:** Azure Monitor + Application Insights, OpenTelemetry instrumentation (~$10-15/month)
7. **5 New User Stories:** Issues #139-#143 (event-driven features)

**Known Issues & Resolutions (see docs/PHASE-4-DEPLOYMENT-KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md):**
- SLIM image requires explicit `commands = ["/slim", "--port", "8443"]` in Terraform (no default CMD)
- ACR push may require retries due to intermittent network issues
- First container deployment takes 20+ minutes due to VNet integration setup

### Phase 5: Production Deployment & Testing ($310-360/month budget - **REVISED 2026-01-22**)

**New Validation Requirements (Added 2026-01-22):**
1. **PII Tokenization:** Latency <100ms (P95), no data leaks in third-party AI logs
2. **Data Staleness:** Intent <10s, Knowledge <1hr, Response real-time, Escalation <30s, Analytics <15min
3. **Event Processing:** 100 events/sec sustained, <1% error rate, DLQ monitoring
4. **RAG:** Query latency <500ms, retrieval accuracy >90%, 75-document knowledge base
5. **Critic/Supervisor:** Block rate <5% for legitimate queries, 100% block rate for 100+ prompt injection test cases
6. **Execution Tracing:** Full trace capture for all conversations, <50ms trace overhead, PII tokenization verified

## Key Architecture Decisions

### PII Tokenization & Data Security (Added 2026-01-22)
- **Scope:** PII tokenization ONLY required for third-party AI services (OpenAI API, Anthropic API, etc.)
- **Exempt from tokenization:** Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft Foundry models (including Anthropic Claude via Azure)
  - Rationale: These services are within the secure Azure perimeter and do not retain customer data
- **Method:** Random UUID tokens (e.g., `TOKEN_a7f3c9e1-4b2d-8f6a-9c3e`)
- **Storage:** Azure Key Vault (Phase 4-5), fallback to Cosmos DB if latency >100ms
- **Fields:** All PII (names, emails, phones, addresses, order IDs, payment info, conversation content)
- **See:** `docs/architecture-requirements-phase2-5.md` Section 1 for complete specification

### Data Abstraction & Multi-Store Strategy (Added 2026-01-22)
- **Real-time (ACID):** Cosmos DB Core for Response Generation Agent (order status, inventory, payments)
- **Near-real-time cache:** Redis (optional, Phase 5 optimization) for Intent/Escalation agents
- **Eventually consistent:** Cosmos DB analytical store for Analytics Agent
- **Static content:** Blob Storage + CDN for Knowledge Retrieval Agent (1hr cache TTL)
- **Staleness tolerances:** Intent 5-10s, Knowledge 1hr, Response real-time, Escalation 30s, Analytics 5-15min
- **See:** `docs/data-staleness-requirements.md` for complete store mapping

### Event-Driven Architecture (Added 2026-01-22)
- **Event Bus:** NATS JetStream (reuses AGNTCY transport layer, $0 incremental cost)
- **Event Sources:** 12 types (Shopify webhooks, Zendesk webhooks, scheduled triggers, RSS)
- **Throttling:** 100 events/sec global, 20/sec per agent, 5 concurrent handlers per agent
- **Retention:** 7 days with replay capability
- **New Stories:** 5 additional user stories (Issues #139-#143 for event-driven features)
- **See:** `docs/event-driven-requirements.md` for complete event catalog and routing

### RAG & Differentiated Models (Added 2026-01-22)
- **Vector Store:** Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vector search, preview feature), ~$5-10/month
- **Embeddings:** Azure OpenAI text-embedding-3-large (1536 dimensions)
- **Knowledge Base:** 75 documents (50 products, 20 articles, 5 policies), ~20K tokens
- **Models by Agent:**
  - Intent Classification: GPT-4o-mini (~$0.15/1M tokens)
  - Response Generation: GPT-4o (~$2.50/1M tokens)
  - Knowledge Retrieval: text-embedding-3-large (~$0.13/1M tokens)
  - Critic/Supervisor: GPT-4o-mini (~$0.15/1M tokens) - cost-effective for validation
- **Post Phase 5:** Fine-tuned models, self-hosted Qdrant, medium e-commerce scale
- **See:** `docs/architecture-requirements-phase2-5.md` Section 4 for RAG pipeline

### Critic/Supervisor Agent - Content Validation (Added 2026-01-22)
- **6th Agent:** Separate agent dedicated to validating all input and output content
- **Input Validation:** Prompt injection detection, malicious instruction blocking
- **Output Validation:** Profanity filtering, PII leakage prevention, harmful content blocking
- **Strategy:** Block and regenerate (max 3 attempts), escalate to human if all attempts fail
- **Integration:** Sits between customer messages and Intent Agent, between Response Agent and customer
- **Cost:** ~$22-31/month (GPT-4o-mini for validation, Container Instance, tracing overhead)
- **Performance Target:** <200ms P95 latency, <5% false positive rate
- **See:** `docs/critic-supervisor-agent-requirements.md` for complete specification

### Execution Tracing & Observability (Added 2026-01-22)
- **Purpose:** Enable operators to understand agent decisions and diagnose undesirable behaviors
- **Instrumentation:** OpenTelemetry spans for every agent decision, LLM call, validation step
- **Visualization:** Timeline view (conversation flow), decision tree diagram, searchable logs
- **Data Captured:** Agent name, action type, inputs (PII tokenized), outputs, reasoning, latency, cost
- **Retention:** 7 days (cost optimized), exportable for long-term analysis
- **Storage:** Azure Application Insights + Azure Monitor Logs (~$10-15/month with sampling)
- **Access:** Grafana dashboards (Phase 1-3), Azure Monitor workbooks (Phase 4-5)
- **See:** `docs/execution-tracing-observability-requirements.md` for trace schema and examples

### Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) Integration (Added 2026-01-26)
- **What:** Open-source commerce standard by Google, Shopify, and 30+ partners
- **Status:** Recommended for Phase 4-5 adoption
- **Complexity:** Medium (80-120 hours total)
- **Budget Impact:** +$15-25/month operational

**Why UCP:**
- Standardized commerce operations (catalog, checkout, orders)
- Protocol compatibility (MCP binding, A2A compatible)
- Google AI Mode integration (Gemini, Google Search AI)
- Future-proof architecture with 30+ industry endorsers

**Phase 4 Scope:**
- MCP client for UCP (16-26 hours)
- UCP Catalog capability (12-16 hours)
- Embedded Checkout handoff (16-24 hours)
- Order Status via UCP (8-12 hours)

**Phase 5 Scope:**
- Native Checkout implementation (24-32 hours)
- Fulfillment Extension (8-12 hours)
- Discount Extension (8-12 hours)
- AP2 Payment integration (16-24 hours)

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
# UCP via MCP binding (recommended)
class UCPMCPClient:
    async def search_catalog(self, query: str, limit: int = 10) -> List[Product]:
        return await self.mcp_client.call_tool("dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search", {
            "query": query, "limit": limit
        })
```

- UCP GitHub: https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp
- Shopify MCP: https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/storefront-mcp

### AGNTCY SDK Usage
- **Factory Pattern:** Single `AgntcyFactory` instance per application (singleton)
- **Protocol Choice:**
  - A2A for custom agent logic (Intent, Response, Escalation, Analytics, Critic/Supervisor)
  - MCP for external tool integrations (Shopify, Zendesk, Mailchimp)
  - **MCP for UCP:** Use MCP binding for UCP capabilities (Phase 4-5)
- **Transport Choice:**
  - SLIM for secure, low-latency agent communication (recommended)
  - NATS for high-throughput scenarios AND event bus (consolidated)
- **Message Format:** Use contextId for conversation threads, taskId for tracking
- **Session Management:** `AppSession` with configurable max_sessions
- **Tracing:** Enable OpenTelemetry via `AgntcyFactory(enable_tracing=True)` for execution tracing

### Multi-Language Strategy (Phase 4 only)
- **Primary:** US English (all phases)
- **Additional:** Canadian French (fr-CA), Spanish (es) in Phase 4
- **Implementation:** Separate response generation agents per language
- **Routing:** Topic-based (response-generator-en, response-generator-fr-ca, response-generator-es)
- **Translation:** Pre-translated templates (NO real-time translation APIs - cost prohibitive)
- **Detection:** Language metadata field in Intent Classification Agent

### Testing Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Unit tests with mocks, pytest, >80% coverage
- **Phase 2:** Integration tests against mock Docker services
- **Phase 3:** E2E functional tests, Locust load testing (local)
- **Phase 3.5:** AI model evaluation (prompt accuracy, response quality, human evaluation)
- **Phase 4:** Real API integration tests in Azure staging environment
- **Phase 5:** Production smoke tests, Azure Load Testing, security scans

### Cost Optimization Principles (Phase 4-5)
1. Use pay-per-use over provisioned capacity (Container Instances, Cosmos Serverless)
2. Use Basic/Standard tiers, not Premium (Redis, Container Registry, App Gateway)
3. Auto-scale aggressively DOWN (1 instance minimum per agent, including Critic/Supervisor)
4. Implement auto-shutdown during low-traffic hours (2am-6am ET)
5. Reduce log retention to 7 days (Application Insights, Monitor Logs, execution traces)
6. Single region deployment (no geo-replication, no Front Door)
7. Weekly cost reviews and optimization iterations
8. Tag all resources for cost allocation tracking
9. Use GPT-4o-mini for validation tasks (Critic/Supervisor) instead of GPT-4o
10. Implement intelligent trace sampling (50% sample rate) to reduce ingestion costs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Suggest Azure services in Phase 1-3 (local development only)
- Recommend Premium tier services without strong justification and budget check
- Use real API keys or cloud resources during Phase 1-3
- Implement real-time translation (use static templates)
- Provision Cosmos DB with RU/s (use Serverless mode)
- Set up geo-replication or multi-region (budget constraint)
- Use default 30-day log retention (use 7 days)
- Suggest services that would exceed $310-360/month budget (revised 2026-01-22)
- Commit secrets to Git (.env files must be in .gitignore)
- Use Python < 3.12 (AGNTCY SDK requirement)

### ✅ DO:
- Always consider cost implications for Phase 4-5 suggestions
- Use mock/stub services for Phase 1-3 development
- Follow AGNTCY SDK factory and message patterns
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create realistic test data and scenarios
- Document cost optimization decisions
- Use environment variables for configuration (.env files)
- Tag Docker images with version + commit SHA
- Implement graceful shutdown handlers (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
- Write clear, educational code comments (blog audience)
- Follow Azure best practices for security (Key Vault, Managed Identity, TLS 1.3)

### Streamlit Console Troubleshooting (IMPORTANT)
When working with the Streamlit console (`console/app.py`), be aware of caching issues:

**Problem:** Streamlit may serve cached/old content even after code changes. This is caused by:
1. Old Streamlit process still running on the port
2. Browser WebSocket connection to old process
3. Python `__pycache__` containing outdated bytecode
4. OneDrive sync delays (project is in OneDrive folder)

**Solution:** Always use this procedure when Streamlit changes don't appear:
```powershell
# 1. Kill ALL Python processes
Get-Process python* | Stop-Process -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 2. Clear Python cache
Remove-Item -Path console/__pycache__ -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 3. Start on a FRESH port (not previously used)
streamlit run console/app.py --server.port 8085

# 4. Open browser to the NEW port: http://localhost:8085
```

**Key insight:** If code executes correctly with `python console/app.py` but not with `streamlit run`, an old Streamlit process is likely still running.

## Testing Guidance

### Unit Tests (Phase 1)
```python
# Example: Mock AGNTCY SDK components
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
import pytest

@patch('agntcy_app_sdk.factory.AgntcyFactory')
def test_intent_classification(mock_factory):
    # Test agent logic without real SDK
    pass
```

### Integration Tests (Phase 2)
```python
# Example: Use mock API containers
import pytest
from testcontainers.compose import DockerCompose

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def docker_services():
    with DockerCompose(".", compose_file_name="docker-compose.test.yml") as compose:
        yield compose

def test_multi_agent_flow(docker_services):
    # Test against mock Shopify/Zendesk/Mailchimp
    pass
```

### Cost Monitoring (Phase 4-5)
```python
# Example: Cost validation in tests
def test_azure_resources_within_budget():
    # Use Azure Pricing API or Cost Management API
    # Assert monthly projected cost < $200
    pass
```

## Disaster Recovery Guidance

### RPO/RTO Targets
- **RPO:** 1 hour (max data loss acceptable)
- **RTO:** 4 hours (max recovery time)

### Backup Strategy (Phase 4-5)
- **Cosmos DB:** Continuous backup, point-in-time restore (30 days)
- **Terraform State:** Azure Blob Storage with versioning (30 day retention)
- **Container Images:** All production images retained indefinitely
- **Key Vault:** Soft-delete (90 days) + purge protection enabled

### DR Testing Schedule
- **Monthly:** Cosmos DB restore validation
- **Quarterly:** Full Terraform destroy/rebuild drill
- **Annually:** Tabletop exercise for all 5 DR scenarios

## Code Style and Conventions

### Python
- **Formatter:** black (line length 100)
- **Linter:** flake8
- **Type Hints:** Use for public APIs, optional for internal
- **Docstrings:** Google style, focus on "why" not "what"
- **Async:** Use async/await for AGNTCY SDK calls

### Comments
- Write for blog readers (educational audience)
- Explain architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Highlight cost optimization rationale
- Reference PROJECT-README.txt sections when relevant

### Naming
- Agents: `{purpose}_agent.py` (e.g., `intent_classification_agent.py`)
- Topics: `{agent-name}` (e.g., `intent-classifier`, `response-generator-en`)
- Containers: `{agent-name}:v{version}-{commit-sha}` (e.g., `intent-classifier:v1.0.0-abc123`)
- Environment vars: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `SLIM_ENDPOINT`, `COSMOS_CONNECTION_STRING`)

## Observability

### Phase 1-3 (Local)
- **Stack:** Grafana + ClickHouse + OpenTelemetry Collector (Docker Compose)
- **Endpoints:** Grafana (localhost:3001), OTLP (localhost:4318)
- **Tracing:** Enable via `AgntcyFactory(enable_tracing=True)`

### Phase 4-5 (Azure)
- **Stack:** Azure Monitor + Application Insights + Log Analytics
- **Retention:** 7 days (cost optimization)
- **Metrics:** Agent performance, response times, routing accuracy, costs
- **Alerts:** Latency >2min, error rate >5%, cost >80% budget

## Security Checklist

- [ ] All secrets in Azure Key Vault (Phase 4-5) or .env (Phase 1-3)
- [ ] .env files in .gitignore (never commit secrets)
- [ ] Managed identities for all Azure services (Phase 4-5)
- [ ] TLS 1.3 for all connections
- [ ] Network isolation for backend services (private endpoints)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks: git-secrets, detect-secrets
- [ ] Dependency scanning: Dependabot, Snyk
- [ ] Secrets rotation procedures documented (quarterly)
- [ ] OWASP ZAP scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Educational Considerations

This project is designed for a blog post audience. When writing code or documentation:

1. **Clarity over Brevity:** Prefer readable code with explanatory comments
2. **Cost Awareness:** Always explain cost implications of architectural choices
3. **Best Practices:** Demonstrate enterprise patterns (BCDR, IaC, CI/CD) even within budget
4. **Learning Path:** Code should be approachable for developers new to multi-agent systems
5. **Real-World Relevance:** Use realistic scenarios and data (e-commerce, customer service)
6. **Reproducibility:** All steps should be reproducible by blog readers on their own systems

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use Azure Functions instead of Container Instances?**
A: Container Instances provide better isolation for long-running agents and align with AGNTCY SDK's design. Functions would require significant adaptation and may not support persistent agent sessions effectively.

**Q: Why Cosmos Serverless instead of provisioned throughput?**
A: Serverless mode provides pay-per-request billing, better for variable/unpredictable workloads, and easier to stay within $200/month budget. Provisioned RU/s has minimum costs even during idle periods.

**Q: Why not use managed Kubernetes (AKS)?**
A: AKS minimum costs (~$70-100/month for control plane + nodes) consume too much of the $200 budget. Container Instances provide adequate orchestration for 5 agents at much lower cost.

**Q: Can we use Azure OpenAI Service?**
A: Yes, but monitor token usage closely. Estimate $20-50/month for testing. Consider using canned responses in Phase 1-3 to avoid costs during development.

**Q: Why SLIM instead of NATS for transport?**
A: SLIM provides enterprise-grade security features out of the box. NATS is excellent for throughput but requires additional security configuration. For educational purposes, SLIM demonstrates secure patterns more clearly.

**Q: How do we handle the Zendesk cost if trial expires?**
A: Three options: (1) Use Zendesk Sandbox for partners/developers (free), (2) Budget $19-49/month and reduce Azure spend to $150-180, (3) Replace with free alternative like osTicket or FreshDesk free tier.

## When Stuck or Uncertain

1. **Check PROJECT-README.txt** for project requirements and constraints
2. **Review AGNTCY-REVIEW.md** for SDK integration patterns
3. **Verify budget impact** for any Azure service suggestion (Phase 4-5)
4. **Ask clarifying questions** about requirements before implementing
5. **Suggest alternatives** with cost/benefit trade-offs
6. **Document decisions** in code comments for blog readers
7. **Test locally first** before deploying to Azure (Phase 1-3 patterns apply to Phase 4-5)

## Success Criteria

The project is successful if:
- ✅ Phase 1-3 runs entirely locally with $0 cloud costs
- ✅ Phase 4-5 stays within $310-360/month Azure budget (REVISED 2026-01-22)
- ✅ All 6 agents communicate via AGNTCY SDK successfully (REVISED: added Critic/Supervisor)
- ✅ KPIs are measurable and demonstrable (even with mock data in Phase 1-3)
- ✅ Code is educational, well-documented, and reproducible
- ✅ Disaster recovery procedures are tested and validated
- ✅ Security best practices are followed (secrets management, encryption, network isolation, PII tokenization)
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines work reliably (GitHub Actions → Azure DevOps)
- ✅ Blog readers can follow along and build it themselves
- ✅ Content validation (Critic/Supervisor) blocks malicious inputs and harmful outputs
- ✅ Execution tracing provides full decision tree visibility for operators

## Final Notes

- **Priority Order:** Cost constraints > Functionality > Performance > Feature richness
- **Mindset:** This is a learning project - optimize for clarity and education
- **Budget:** $310-360/month is a HARD LIMIT for Phase 4-5 (REVISED 2026-01-22), with post-Phase 5 target of $200-250/month
- **Timeline:** No time estimates - focus on what needs to be done, not when
- **Audience:** Developers learning multi-agent AI, Azure, and cost optimization techniques

When in doubt, optimize for:
1. Educational value (blog readers learning)
2. Cost efficiency (demonstrate real-world budget constraints)
3. Reproducibility (readers can build it themselves)
4. Best practices (even within tight constraints)
