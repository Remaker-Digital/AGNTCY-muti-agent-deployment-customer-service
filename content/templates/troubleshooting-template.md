# Product/Topic Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Diagnostics

Before diving into specific issues, try these basic steps:

1. **Power cycle:** Turn off, wait 30 seconds, turn back on
2. **Check connections:** Ensure all cables/parts are properly connected
3. **Update software:** Check for firmware or app updates
4. **Factory reset:** As a last resort (see instructions below)

## Common Problems

### Problem 1: [Describe the symptom the customer sees]

**Example:** Coffee maker not brewing / No water coming out

**Likely Causes:**
1. Water reservoir not properly seated
2. Clogged water line
3. Heating element issue

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Check the water reservoir**
   - Remove and reseat the reservoir
   - Ensure it clicks into place
   - Fill to the minimum line

2. **Run a cleaning cycle**
   - Fill reservoir with equal parts water and white vinegar
   - Run a brew cycle without coffee
   - Run 2-3 cycles with plain water to rinse

3. **Inspect for blockages**
   - Check the water intake for debris
   - Clean with a soft brush
   - Ensure the filter basket is clean

4. **Test again**
   - Fill with fresh water
   - Attempt a normal brew cycle

**If the issue persists:** Contact support for warranty service.

### Problem 2: [Second common symptom]

**Example:** Machine making unusual noise

**Likely Causes:**
1. Air in the water line
2. Loose internal component
3. Scale buildup

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Purge air from the system**
   - Run 3-4 short brew cycles
   - This forces air out of the water line

2. **Descale the machine**
   - Use our descaling solution (Part #12345)
   - Follow the descaling instructions in user manual
   - Repeat monthly for best performance

3. **Check for loose parts**
   - Open the top cover
   - Ensure all components are properly seated
   - Tighten any visible loose screws

**If noise continues:** The machine may need professional service.

### Problem 3: [Third common symptom]

**What this means:** Water temperature sensor malfunction

**Resolution Steps:**

1. **Power cycle the machine**
   - Unplug for 2 minutes
   - Plug back in and try again

2. **Check water temperature**
   - Ensure you're using room temperature water
